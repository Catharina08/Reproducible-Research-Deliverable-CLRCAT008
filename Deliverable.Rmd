## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r iris}
captures <- read.csv("iris.csv")
summary(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length, y = iris$Sepal.Width, main = "Sepal Length by Width", xlim = c(4,8.5), ylim = c(1.5,5), xlab = "Sepal Length (mm)", ylab = "Sepal Width (mm)")

plot(x = iris$Petal.Length, y = iris$Petal.Width, main = "Petal Length by Width", xlim = c(0,8), ylim = c(0,3), xlab = "Petal Length (mm)", ylab = "Petal Width (mm)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
